        <p>A split air conditioner is a type of air conditioning system that has two main parts: an indoor unit and an outdoor unit. The indoor unit circulates cool air into the room, while the outdoor unit removes heat from the room. 
        Features 
        Cooling capacity
        Split air conditioners can cool multiple rooms or large areas. The cooling capacity of a split air conditioner depends on its size and the size of the room it's cooling.
        Noise level
        Split air conditioners are designed to be quiet, making them ideal for bedrooms, living rooms, and offices.
        Energy efficiency
        Split air conditioners can be efficient at cooling while minimizing energy use.
        Customizable cooling zones
        Some split air conditioners allow you to set different cooling temperatures for different areas of your home.
        Installation 
        Split air conditioners are often installed by professionals because of the complexity of connecting the indoor and outdoor units.
        The indoor unit is usually mounted on a wall or ceiling, while the outdoor unit is placed outside the building.
        Factors to consider 
        Room layout: The layout of the room you want to cool can help you determine the size and type of split air conditioner you need.
        Energy efficiency: Consider how energy efficient the split air conditioner is.
        Additional features: Some split air conditioners have additional features like programmable thermostats or air purification systems.</p>

        <p>A portable room air conditioner operates by drawing warm air from the room into the unit. This air passes through a filter, which cleans it by removing particles and dust. As the air moves over the evaporator coils, it cools down. These coils contain refrigerant, which absorbs the heat from the air.</p>

       <p>A window air conditioner is the simplest type of AC unit. It's a single unit with all of the parts and components contained inside one box or casing. This type of AC is usually mounted or installed in a window and plugs into a traditional electrical outlet.16-Sept-2023</p>
